Leaders planning to retake the class as followers (and vice versa) are expected to register and pay for the class normally. Students retaking Swing 1 do not receive the free entry to Lindy Jam perk, sorry!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShould a student decide to retake an intro level class, they should follow the link for online registration, complete the online form and \u0022Submit\u0022 as is the normal procedure. Do not continue to the payment procedure via PayPal; the student should send an email to \u003Ca type=\u0022external\u0022 href=\u0022mailto:info@groovejuiceswing.com\u0022 target=\u0022\u0022 data-router-slot=\u0022disabled\u0022\u003Einfo@groovejuiceswing.com\u003C/a\u003E after registering to indicate that they are retaking the class. Any balance will be collected at the door.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStudents should be aware that first-time, full-paying students are the group\u0027s priority. In the eventuality of students needing individual attention from teachers, whether inside or outside of class, paying students will be given first priority before any student taking advantage of the retake policy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough there is no official policy that limits the number of times a student may retake a certain class, the group may decide to deny a student the retake opportunity if it feels the student will not be able to gain any additional experience from the class.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EOur refer-a-friend policy\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are always excited to have new students. Groove Juice Swing offers a discount to students who sign up a friend and \u0022spread the love\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAny student who refers another will receive a $5 discount off the price of any one class session. We can only offer this discount once per student per class session; there are no additional discounts for referring multiple friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be eligible, a student (and the student\u0027s friend) must make it known at the time of registration that they are taking advantage of this policy, and both must be registering for a scheduled upcoming class session. To do that, students should follow the link for online registration, complete the online form and \u0022Submit\u0022 as is the normal procedure. Do not continue to the payment procedure via PayPal; the student should send an email to \u003Ca type=\u0022external\u0022 href=\u0022mailto:info@groovejuiceswing.com\u0022 target=\u0022\u0022 data-router-slot=\u0022disabled\u0022\u003Einfo@groovejuiceswing.com\u003C/a\u003E after registering to indicate the name of the friend that they are referring. Groove Juice Swing will contact those students registering in this manner with payment instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EClass size policy\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the case where there are 3 or less students signed up for a class, we will hold the first class of the series as planned, but may cancel the remaining weeks (usually 3) and refund 75% of each student\u0027s payment for the series. This choice will be up to the discretion of the class instructors at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to space limitations, classes are capped at 50 people. In the case where more than 50 people sign up, we may split into two smaller groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ESnow policy\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe do our best to hold class as normal throughout this snowy season. However, if roads are dangerous and class needs to be canceled and rescheduled, we will email students and post on social media by noon the day of class. For this reason, please make sure to provide an accurate email so we can reach you on these occasions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EMake up/review classes\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Swing 1, we offer $5 half-hour group review sessions directly preceding each class, weeks 2, 3 \u0026amp; 4. This is for students who miss a week to make up the material, and also for those who want a little more time with the instructors.
